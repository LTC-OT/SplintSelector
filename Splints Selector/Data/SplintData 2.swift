    The splint is applied with the proximal interphalangeal joint at 45 degrees of flexion and secured at the proximal part of the finger crossing metacarpophlanageal joint.

    The flexion is decreased 15 degrees until reaching full extension over four weeks. Buddy taping should follow.

    For this splint, the distal interphalangeal joint is placed in slight hyperextension with a padded dorsal splint, an unpadded volar splint, or a prefabricated mallet finger splint.
    The splint is kept for 6-8 weeks.

    Night splinting for an additional two to three weeks is recommended

    The splint is put along the radial aspect of the forearm and extends from just beyond the distal interphalangeal joint of the index finger, leaving the thumb free. Proximally, the extent is up to just short of elbow joint.

    The wrist is placed in slight extension, with the MCP joints in 70 to 90 degrees of flexion, and the interphalangeal joints in 5 to 10 degrees of flexion.

    First carpometacarpal joint arthritis.
    The splint covers the radial aspect of the forearm, from the proximal one-third of the forearm to just distal to the interphalangeal joint of the thumb.

    The forearm is in the neutral position with the wrist extended to 25 degrees and the thumb in a position of function. Imagine holding a glass or a cold drink can. This is the functional position of the thumb.
